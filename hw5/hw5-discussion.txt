1: Should the execution of a command without access to other comamands in the
queue:

  Yes, it should. With the nature of network communication and concurrency
  execution command execution may not follow the FIFO nature of the queue, 
  causing out of order execution.

  ie: DEPOSIT -> acount 1
      TRANSFER -> account 1 --> account 2

  possible execution outside of lock
    TRANSFER
    DEPOSIT

    even though the deposit command came first, order of execution would cause
    the transfer to fail 



2: peformance implications

  Yes, it does affect the peformance. From the execution results, performance is
  reduced by ~75% because of the additional locking introduced
