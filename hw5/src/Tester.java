/*
 * Tester contains three tests:
 *
 * 1) testSetup: Sets up a BankServer, creating a set of Accounts and depositing INITIAL_BALANCE in each, using
 *    the Deposit command. The BankServer is then shut down, and verifies that the total of all balances is as expected.
 *
 * 2) testCorrectness: Sets up a BankServer, creating a set of Accounts and depositing INITIAL_BALANCE in each,
 *    using the Deposit command. It then uses a set of TestThreads to submit commands to the BankServer concurrently.
 *    Once all the commands have been executed, the total of all the balances is checked for correctness. Because
 *    the TestThreads submit only Transfer commands, the total balance should be INITIAL_BALANCE * ACCOUNTS.
 *
 * 2) measurePerformanceOfCommandInsideAndOutsideMonitor: This runs the exact same test as testCorrectness, twice.
 *    once with command execution inside the monitor, once outside. The total execution time is measured each way,
 *    and the transaction rate for each run is reported.
 *
 * All of these tests call runTest to do their work. runTest does the following:
 *
 *     - Creates a BankServer, by calling createBankServer. createBankServer creates a BankImpl, and creates a set
 *       of Accounts and associates each with the Bank. Then, a BankServerImpl is created to encapsulate the BankImpl.
 *       Finally, INITIAL_BALANCE is added to each Account by submitting a Deposit command.
 *
 *     - A set of TestThreads are created (unless clientThreads is zero). Each TestThread will submit a number of
 *       Transfer transactions to the Bank, via the BankServer, (this is similar to what was done in HW4). Note that
 *       runTest has three loops, to create the TestThreads, to start each thread, and then to join them.
 *       (Joining a thread returns from execution when the thread being joined terminates.)
 *
 *     - Stops the BankServer, which causes all of the CommandExecutionThreads to terminate.
 *
 *     - Checks the balance, now that all of the Transfer commands have executed.
